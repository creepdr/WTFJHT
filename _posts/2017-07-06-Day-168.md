1/ **Trump downplayed Russian election meddling, saying it "could be Russia" but "nobody really knows for sure."** He added that it "could’ve been other people and other countries," casting doubt on the conclusion of 17 US intelligence agencies and likening it to the incorrect assessment that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. He blamed Obama for not doing anything to stop the meddling. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-06/trump-cites-russian-election-meddling-but-blames-others-too) / [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/06/politics/trump-election-meddling-russia/index.html) / [The Daily Beast](http://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-attacks-u-s-spies-says-other-people-could-have-hacked-2016))

2/ **Trump to Russia: stop “destabilizing activities” and end support for “hostile regimes,”** like Iran and Syria. The remark came during his speech in Poland the day before he meets with Putin for the first time.  ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/world/europe/donald-trump-poland-g20-hamburg.html) / [NBC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/donald-trump-u-s-will-confront-north-korea-over-very-n779986))

3/ **Trump reaffirmed NATO's mutual defense clause**, after failing to do so on first Europe trip. He then called on allies to honor the agreement to contribute at least 2% of their GDP to their own defense. ([CNBC](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/06/trump-us-stands-firmly-behind-nato-article-5.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/07/06/in-poland-trump-reaffirms-commitment-to-nato-chides-russia/))

4/ **Military spending alone is not enough as Trump asks "whether the West has the will to survive."** He told the [bused-in, friendly Polish crowd](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/07/05/Day-167/#7-trump-flew-to-europe-today-stoppin) that “radical Islamic terrorism” has threatened “our civilization and our way of life," adding that "the fundamental question of our time" is whether "we have the confidence in our values to defend them at any cost? Do we have enough respect for our citizens to protect our borders? Do we have the desire and the courage to preserve our civilization in the face of those who would subvert and destroy it?” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/world/europe/donald-trump-poland-speech.html))

5/ **Meanwhile, the Trump Organization renewed its Russia-related domain names**. TrumpRussia.com and TrumpTowerMoscow.com are just two of more than 1,000 domain names renewed by the organization, which has said it will not pursue any new foreign business deals while Trump is in the White House.

6/ **Trump vs North Korea: They're "behaving in a very, very dangerous manner."** Trump said he could respond to the North's missile test with "some pretty severe things," declining to elaborate. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/06/politics/trump-poland-duda/index.html))

7/ **The voter fraud commission may have violated the law**, by ignoring federal requirements governing requests for information from states. The failure is potentially significant, since states could argue it means they are under no obligation to respond.

8/ **Steve Bannon's ally on the National Security Council has been reassigned**. The move enables National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster to consolidate power by placing another staffer of his choosing on the council.

9/ **Top White House aides have hired public relation staffs to support their own agendas** instead of using the traditional White House policy and messaging operation. Kellyanne Conway, Steve Bannon, and Jared Kushner all have chiefs of staff, assistants, and PR people working for them in an effort to build up their own brands and policy portfolios. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/06/trump-west-wing-staff-kushner-240244))

10/ **18 states are suing Betsy DeVos for delaying student loan regulations** meant to protect borrowers from being defrauded by predatory schools. The regulations were finalized by the Obama administration and were set to take effect on July 1. DeVos has delayed the implementation of the rules.

12/ **The government's ethics director resigns, saying rules need to be tougher**. Walter Shaub Jr., the government’s top ethics watchdog, resignation follows months of clashes with the White House over Trump's refusal to divest his businesses and the administration's delay in disclosing ethics waivers for appointees. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/us/politics/walter-shaub-office-of-government-ethics-resign.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal-ethics-chief-who-clashed-with-white-house-announces-he-will-step-down/2017/07/06/4732c308-624c-11e7-a4f7-af34fc1d9d39_story.html) / [NPR](http://www.npr.org/2017/07/06/535781749/ethics-office-director-walter-shaub-resigns-saying-rules-need-to-be-tougher))
